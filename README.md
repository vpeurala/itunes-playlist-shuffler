This is a very simple and unpolished script which I wrote very quickly because
I had a need to shuffle a long iTunes playlist and I didn't find anything suitable
immediately.

There is no proper error handling in place yet. Maybe there will never be.
There are also a couple of other TODO items in the script. Maybe I will fix
them someday or maybe not, I already got what I wanted (I managed to randomize
the order of a 1472-song playlist).

So: feel free to use this script, but don't expect it to work perfectly. The script
makes a lot of assumptions which are not documented anywhere. And if it breaks something,
I am not responsible.
